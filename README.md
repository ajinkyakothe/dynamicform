The dynamic form logic allows users to define and generate customizable forms based on a JSON schema. The schema specifies details like form title, description, and fields with properties such as type (text, email, select, radio, etc.), labels, placeholders, validation rules, and options. Using this schema, the form dynamically renders fields and applies validation. Users can input data into the form, and upon submission, the data is processed or downloaded as JSON. Additionally, the logic supports themes (light/dark) and ensures a seamless user experience with responsive styling and error handling.
The form is rendered dynamically based on this schema, allowing for flexible and reusable designs. It includes real-time validation and submission handling, ensuring data integrity. The setup also supports theme switching (light/dark mode) and additional features like downloading submissions as JSON.
